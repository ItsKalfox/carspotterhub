                    The idea of cars driving themselves was once a futuristic fantasy depicted in sci-fi movies, but
                    today it is rapidly becoming a transformative reality. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to
                    revolutionize the automotive industry and reshape the way we think about mobility. These vehicles
                    leverage cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, and real-time
                    data processing to operate without human intervention. As they become more prevalent, self-driving
                    cars have the potential to make transportation safer, more efficient, and accessible to a broader
                    range of people. In this article, we will explore how autonomous vehicles are shaping the future of
                    driving, the technology behind them, their benefits and challenges, and what lies ahead.

                        Autonomous vehicles, also known as self-driving cars, use advanced technologies such as sensors,
                        cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate and control the car without human
                        intervention.
